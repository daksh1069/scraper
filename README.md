Recommended - Run in a Virtual Environment ! 

1. Creat and Run a Virtual Environment

2. Run pip install -r *path to requirements.txt* on terminal ( also run "pip install openpyxl" on your venv ).

3. Once Installation completes, Simply run Final Scraper.py File and keep track of the logs on the 
console ( in case some error pops up )

4. Once Completely Run Successfully, Console will ask - press Enter to Exit. You may do so to exit 
* For Now Logs will be erased forever though * ( I'm working on it )

5. You'll find 2 Files Namely - tempdata.csv or excel-temp.xlsx (for xlsx, Might need to install openpyxl ) 
I forgot to add it in requirements.txt. I, myself installed it later on xD

6. If an Automated Chrome Browser Opens up randomly, don't close it or change tabs, or even click any buttons on it. Let it run. 
You should close it after program has exited though. ( I'll add auto closing feature in next iteration )

7. In case you face any unexpected problem - Just re-run Final Scraper.py. It should automatically resolve.

8. You May Input the Values, else I already have them set to the Default if you decide to Skip this part. Kindly Enter the value as mentioned.

IMP - It is recommended that you manually search ( using same details ) to check if the website is loading and functioning properly. If it is not this code might use resources
 ( although it has an automatic selfkill function, still it is better to ensure it isn't running manually just in case )
